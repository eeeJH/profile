Hi, visitor. I'm Lee. 

The sentence below is my study principle.

```
1. Do not just study, do programming yourself.
2. Don't think you're not ready, go back to number 1 and make something.
3. Don't overdo it at the beginning and get into the habit of programming every day.
4. Don't study just by looking at the list. There is no end to learning.
5. Study by setting a period.
```

Is it cool? Ha.
